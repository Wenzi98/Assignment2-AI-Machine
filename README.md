üåê Project Overview
This repository contains an AI solution addressing UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by predicting rural access to all-season roads. Our machine learning model helps governments and NGOs prioritize infrastructure investments in underserved regions.

Target: Indicator 9.1.1 - *"Proportion of rural population within 2 km of an all-season road"*
Solution: Random Forest regression model predicting access percentages with 82% accuracy

üéØ Problem Statement
Over 1 billion people globally lack access to all-season roads, with critical disparities:

Africa average: 28.5% access

Middle East average: 85.7% access
(Source: UN SDG Database from Goal9.pdf)

This creates barriers to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Our solution identifies priority regions for infrastructure investment to accelerate SDG 9 progress.

ü§ñ ML Approach
Model: Random Forest Regressor (supervised learning)
Why chosen?

Handles small datasets effectively

Captures non-linear relationships

Provides feature importance interpretation

Technical Workflow:

Data Extraction: 26 data points from UN SDG database

Feature Engineering:

Region classification (Africa, Asia, Middle East, South America)

Decade bins

Access categories (Low: <30%, Medium: 30-60%, High: >60%)

Preprocessing:

Label encoding for categorical features

Standard scaling (mean=0, variance=1)

80/20 train-test split

Training:

100 decision trees with cross-validation

Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV

üíª Installation
bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sdg9-road-access.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core dependencies
numpy==1.23.5
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.2.2
matplotlib==3.7.1
seaborn==0.12.2
üöÄ Usage
Run the main Jupyter notebook:

python
SDG9_Rural_Road_Access_Predictor.ipynb
Key Functions:

python
# Predict access for a country
def predict_access(country, year, region):
    """
    Returns: predicted access percentage
    Example: predict_access('Ethiopia', 2023, 'Africa') ‚Üí 29.8%
    """
Sample Prediction:

python
# Import model
from model import RoadAccessPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = RoadAccessPredictor()

# Make prediction
ethiopia_2023 = predictor.predict('Ethiopia', 2023, 'Africa')
print(f"Predicted access: {ethiopia_2023:.1f}%")
üìä Results
Model Performance
Metric	Value	Interpretation
MAE	6.65%	Average prediction error
R¬≤	0.82	82% variance explained
Cross-validated R¬≤	0.79	Consistent performance
Feature Importance
Country (51.3%) - Historical investment patterns

Year (21.8%) - Positive trend over time

Region (17.2%) - Systemic regional disparities

Road access improvements over time, with regional variations


‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations
Data Bias Mitigation

Oversampled underrepresented regions

Flagged data points >5 years old

Transparency Measures

Public model cards explaining limitations

Uncertainty scores for low-data predictions

Equity Focus

Priority weighting for regions <30% access

Open-source model for community scrutiny
